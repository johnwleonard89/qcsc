		questions: [
			{
				question: 'How long does epoxy flooring last?',
				answer: `Professional epoxy flooring lifespan depends on several factors:

				<strong>Typical Lifespan:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Residential garages: 15-20+ years
				‚Ä¢ Commercial applications: 10-15 years
				‚Ä¢ Industrial environments: 8-12 years

				<strong>Factors Affecting Longevity:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Quality of surface preparation (most important)
				‚Ä¢ Traffic levels and usage patterns
				‚Ä¢ Environmental conditions and maintenance
				‚Ä¢ Quality of materials and installation

				<strong>Signs of Quality Installation:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ No peeling or bubbling after first year
				‚Ä¢ Consistent appearance and performance
				‚Ä¢ Proper adhesion to substrate

				Our epoxy systems regularly exceed expected lifespans due to proper preparation and premium materials.`
			},
			{
				question: 'Can epoxy be applied over existing paint or coatings?',
				answer: `Generally, no - existing coatings should be removed for proper adhesion:

				<strong>Why Removal is Necessary:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Epoxy bonds to concrete, not to paint or other coatings
				‚Ä¢ Existing coatings can fail, taking the epoxy with them
				‚Ä¢ Paint often contains oils or additives that prevent adhesion

				<strong>Proper Preparation Process:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Mechanical removal of all existing coatings
				‚Ä¢ Diamond grinding to achieve proper surface profile
				‚Ä¢ Complete cleaning and decontamination
				‚Ä¢ Moisture and pH testing before application

				<strong>Exception:</strong> Some well-adhered epoxy coatings can be overcoated after proper preparation and adhesion testing.

				We test all existing surfaces and recommend the safest, most durable approach.`
			},
			{
				question: 'What preparation is required?',
				answer: `Proper surface preparation is critical for epoxy success:

				<strong>Assessment Phase:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Moisture testing (concrete must be under 4% moisture)
				‚Ä¢ Oil and contaminant identification
				‚Ä¢ Structural crack evaluation
				‚Ä¢ Surface profile requirements

				<strong>Mechanical Preparation:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Diamond grinding or shotblasting
				‚Ä¢ Crack repair with appropriate materials
				‚Ä¢ Oil stain treatment and removal
				‚Ä¢ Dust removal and surface cleaning

				<strong>Chemical Preparation:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Degreasing and neutralization
				‚Ä¢ pH testing and adjustment if needed
				‚Ä¢ Final cleaning and inspection

				<strong>Quality Control:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Surface profile verification
				‚Ä¢ Cleanliness standards confirmation
				‚Ä¢ Environmental condition monitoring

				Proper preparation takes 40-60% of total project time but ensures long-term success.`
			},
			{
				question: 'How soon can I use my floor after installation?',
				answer: `Cure times vary by system and environmental conditions:

				<strong>Standard Epoxy Systems:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Light foot traffic: 24-48 hours
				‚Ä¢ Normal foot traffic: 72 hours
				‚Ä¢ Vehicle traffic: 7 days
				‚Ä¢ Full chemical resistance: 7-14 days

				<strong>Fast-Cure Polyaspartic:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Light foot traffic: 2-4 hours
				‚Ä¢ Vehicle traffic: 24 hours
				‚Ä¢ Full performance: 24-48 hours

				<strong>Factors Affecting Cure Time:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Temperature (cooler = slower cure)
				‚Ä¢ Humidity levels
				‚Ä¢ Air circulation
				‚Ä¢ Coating thickness

				<strong>Cincinnati Climate Considerations:</strong>
				Winter installations may require extended cure times due to cold temperatures.

				We provide specific timelines based on your project and current conditions.`
			},
			{
				question: 'Is epoxy safe for homes with children and pets?',
				answer: `Yes, properly cured epoxy flooring is completely safe:

				<strong>Once Cured, Epoxy is:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Non-toxic and food-safe
				‚Ä¢ No harmful emissions or off-gassing
				‚Ä¢ Easy to clean and sanitize
				‚Ä¢ Resistant to bacteria and mold growth

				<strong>During Installation:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Temporary ventilation required
				‚Ä¢ Keep children and pets away during application
				‚Ä¢ Full cure required before normal use (typically 24-72 hours)

				<strong>Safety Features:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Slip-resistant additives available
				‚Ä¢ Smooth surface eliminates tripping hazards
				‚Ä¢ Non-porous surface prevents bacterial growth
				‚Ä¢ Easy cleanup of spills and accidents

				<strong>Certifications:</strong>
				Many of our systems meet or exceed FDA and NSF standards for food contact surfaces.

				We prioritize family safety in all installations.`
			},
			{
				question: 'What maintenance is required?',
				answer: `Epoxy flooring requires minimal maintenance when properly installed:

				<strong>Daily/Weekly Care:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Sweep or vacuum to remove dirt and debris
				‚Ä¢ Damp mop with mild detergent as needed
				‚Ä¢ Clean spills promptly to prevent staining
				‚Ä¢ Use walk-off mats to reduce dirt tracking

				<strong>Monthly Maintenance:</strong>
				‚Ä¢ Deep clean with degreasing agents if needed
				‚Ä¢ Inspect for any signs of wear or damage
				‚Ä¢ Apply slip-resistant treatments if required

				<strong>Annual Care:</strong>
