          content: '<h2>From Marine Infantry to Master Craftsman</h2><h3>My Journey</h3><p>After serving two combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine Corps Infantry Machine Gunner, I learned what it truly means to pay attention to details‚Äîbecause lives depended on it. That same precision and commitment to excellence drives everything I do today at Queen City Surface Coatings.</p><p>When I returned home to Cincinnati, I didn\'t just want a job‚ÄîI wanted to build something meaningful for my community and my family. With over 10 years in the construction industry, I\'ve seen too many shortcuts and half-measures that leave customers disappointed. That\'s why I founded Queen City Surface Coatings in 2025: to bring military-grade standards to concrete coatings.</p><h3>Family First</h3><p>My wife and two children are my biggest motivation. Every project I take on, I approach with the same care I\'d want someone to show if they were working on my own family\'s home. When you hire Queen City Surface Coatings, you\'re not just getting a contractor‚Äîyou\'re getting a fellow parent and spouse who understands that your home is your sanctuary.</p><h3>Built on Discipline</h3><p>My time in the Marines taught me that excellence isn\'t negotiable. Whether I was maintaining weapons systems in combat zones or leading fellow Marines through challenging missions, there was no room for "good enough."</p><p>Today, that discipline shows up in every aspect of my work:</p><ul><li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Just like cleaning weapons daily kept us combat-ready, I prep every surface meticulously</li><li><strong>Precision:</strong> The same attention to detail that kept my squad safe now ensures your coating is applied perfectly</li><li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> Marines don\'t leave jobs unfinished, and neither do I</li></ul><h3>Staying Sharp</h3><p>When I\'m not transforming garages and commercial spaces, you\'ll find me on the jiu-jitsu mats. BJJ keeps me mentally sharp and physically prepared‚Äîqualities that translate directly to the problem-solving and physical demands of concrete coating work. The discipline, respect, and continuous improvement mindset of martial arts align perfectly with how I approach every project.</p><h3>Why This Matters to You</h3><p>You deserve more than just another contractor. You deserve someone who:</p><ul><li>Shows up when promised (military punctuality is non-negotiable)</li><li>Communicates clearly (no military jargon, just straight talk about your project)</li><li>Stands behind their work (my reputation and family name are on every job)</li><li>Understands quality (10 years in construction + military standards = no shortcuts)</li></ul><h3>The Cincinnati Connection</h3><p>This is my community. My family lives here, my children go to school here, and my reputation is built here. When you choose Queen City Surface Coatings, you\'re choosing a neighbor who\'s invested in this area for the long haul.</p>'
