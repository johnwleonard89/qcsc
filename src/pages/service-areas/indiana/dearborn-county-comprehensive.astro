	faqs: [
		{
			question: 'What makes Dearborn County unique for concrete coating services?',
			answer: 'Dearborn County\'s combination of seasonal recreation facilities, agricultural operations, historic preservation needs, and riverfront location creates diverse coating requirements. From Perfect North Slopes\' extreme seasonal conditions to Aurora\'s historic preservation needs, plus the agricultural demands throughout rural areas, we\'ve developed expertise across recreation, agriculture, tourism, and heritage applications. The Ohio River valley location also requires moisture-resistant solutions.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you handle seasonal recreation facility requirements like Perfect North Slopes?',
			answer: 'Seasonal recreation facilities face extreme conditions from winter snow sports to summer events. We use specialized coatings designed for temperature extremes, moisture resistance, heavy equipment traffic, and the unique demands of facilities that operate in multiple seasons. Understanding seasonal business cycles helps us schedule work during appropriate maintenance periods.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What\'s your experience with Dearborn County\'s agricultural industry?',
			answer: 'Agricultural applications require coatings that withstand heavy equipment, livestock, weather exposure, and chemical resistance from feeds and cleaning agents. We understand farming operations, seasonal agricultural demands, and the need for durable, practical solutions that work in working farm environments. Our agricultural experience includes livestock facilities, equipment storage, and feed handling areas.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you approach historic preservation in Aurora and other historic areas?',
			answer: 'Historic preservation requires careful attention to architectural guidelines and community character. We work with local preservation groups and understand the importance of maintaining historic integrity while providing modern protection. Aurora\'s riverfront location adds complexity with moisture considerations. Our experience includes buildings dating from the 19th century river commerce era.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What considerations affect Ohio River valley and flood-prone areas?',
			answer: 'The Ohio River valley creates unique moisture and occasional flooding challenges requiring specialized moisture-resistant coatings and application techniques. We understand seasonal river conditions, humidity variations, and the importance of systems that can handle periodic moisture exposure. Our riverfront experience includes properties that must maintain function even during high water periods.'
