	faqs: [
		{
			question: 'What makes Campbell County unique for concrete coating services?',
			answer: 'Campbell County\'s combination of historic riverfront character, tourism industry demands, and suburban growth creates diverse coating requirements. From Newport\'s entertainment district needing heavy-traffic solutions to Fort Thomas\'s historic preservation needs, we\'ve developed expertise in both commercial tourism applications and heritage-sensitive residential work. The county\'s connection to Cincinnati also means familiarity with cross-river coordination and standards.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you handle historic district requirements in Newport and Fort Thomas?',
			answer: 'Historic districts require careful attention to preservation guidelines and architectural sensitivity. We work with local historic commissions, preservation architects, and community stakeholders to ensure our coating solutions enhance and protect historic character rather than compromising it. Our experience includes projects in buildings dating from the Civil War era through early 20th century development.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What\'s your experience with Campbell County\'s tourism industry?',
			answer: 'Tourism facilities like Newport on the Levee require specialized solutions that handle massive pedestrian traffic, frequent cleaning, and maintain attractive appearance for visitors. We understand the seasonal demands, peak usage periods, and the importance of minimizing business disruption during installations. Our tourism industry experience includes restaurants, attractions, and hospitality facilities.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you coordinate projects across the river with Cincinnati operations?',
			answer: 'Campbell County\'s proximity to Cincinnati creates opportunities for coordinated projects and shared resources. We maintain equipment and materials on both sides of the river, understand both Ohio and Kentucky building codes, and can coordinate with Cincinnati-based contractors when projects span the metropolitan area. Our cross-river experience streamlines logistics and scheduling.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What Kentucky-specific considerations affect Campbell County projects?',
			answer: 'Kentucky building codes, environmental regulations, and permit processes differ from Ohio requirements. We\'re fully licensed in Kentucky and maintain relationships with local officials and suppliers. Campbell County\'s river location also means consideration of flood zones, humidity variations, and seasonal weather patterns that affect coating applications and long-term performance.'
