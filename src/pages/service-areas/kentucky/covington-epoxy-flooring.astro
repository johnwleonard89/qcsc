              <h2>Why Choose Us for Covington Epoxy Flooring?</h2>
              
              <h3>Historic Preservation Expertise</h3>
              <p>
                Covington's rich architectural heritage demands specialized knowledge and care. We've worked 
                extensively throughout the historic district, understanding preservation requirements and 
                delivering epoxy solutions that enhance rather than compromise historic character. Our team

              <p>
                Kenton County's position along the Ohio River creates unique environmental challenges for 
                flooring systems. High humidity, seasonal temperature swings, and potential flood conditions 
                require epoxy formulations specifically designed for riverfront properties. We've perfected 
                our approach over 15+ years serving this challenging climate.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Local Business Understanding</h3>
              <p>
                From MainStrasse Village boutiques to downtown corporate offices, we understand Covington's 
                diverse commercial needs. Our epoxy systems support local businesses with minimal disruption 
                installations, health department compliance, and long-lasting durability that keeps operations 
                running smoothly.
