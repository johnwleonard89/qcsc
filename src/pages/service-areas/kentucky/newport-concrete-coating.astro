              <h2>Why Choose Us for Newport Concrete Coating?</h2>
              
              <h3>Riverfront Environment Expertise</h3>
              <p>
                Newport's location at the confluence of the Ohio and Licking Rivers creates unique environmental 
                challenges for concrete surfaces. High humidity levels, seasonal flooding potential, and ground 
                moisture infiltration require specialized coating systems that we've perfected over 15+ years 
                serving Campbell County.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Historic Preservation Knowledge</h3>
              <p>
                We understand the delicate balance required when working with Newport's historic properties. 
                Our coatings preserve the architectural integrity of century-old buildings while providing 
                modern protection and functionality. We work closely with property owners to ensure 
                compliance with historic preservation guidelines.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Local Climate Solutions</h3>
              <p>
                Campbell County's Ohio River Valley climate presents unique challenges - from winter ice 
                storms to humid summer conditions. Our concrete coating systems are formulated to handle 
                these extremes while maintaining their protective and aesthetic properties year-round.
