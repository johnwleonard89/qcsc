		},
		{
			question: 'How do you coordinate with Miami University\'s academic calendar?',
			answer: 'University projects require careful timing around academic schedules, student activities, and seasonal breaks. We plan installations during low-activity periods, work with facilities management to minimize disruption, and can accelerate schedules when needed. Our experience with educational institutions helps us navigate the unique requirements of campus environments.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What\'s your experience with Butler County\'s manufacturing sector?',
			answer: 'Butler County\'s manufacturing heritage means we regularly work with steel processing, automotive parts, and food processing facilities. Each industry has specific requirements - chemical resistance, temperature cycling, heavy load capacity, and FDA compliance. Our industrial experience includes projects ranging from small job shops to major manufacturing complexes.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you handle Butler County\'s rapid suburban growth?',
			answer: 'The county\'s growing communities often involve new construction projects, subdivision developments, and commercial expansions. We work with builders, developers, and contractors to integrate coating services into construction schedules. Our project management handles multiple homes in developments, ensuring consistent quality and timely completion.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What seasonal considerations affect Butler County installations?',
			answer: 'Butler County\'s inland location experiences more temperature variation than Hamilton County. We account for seasonal humidity changes, plan around agricultural schedules in rural areas, and coordinate with the university\'s academic calendar. Spring and fall provide optimal conditions, but we maintain climate-controlled capabilities for year-round service.'
