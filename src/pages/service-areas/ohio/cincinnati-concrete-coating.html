                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do your coatings handle Cincinnati's weather extremes?</h3>
                        <p>Our coating systems are specifically formulated for Cincinnati's continental climate. They remain flexible through freeze-thaw cycles, resist damage from road salt, and maintain their appearance through humid summers and harsh winters. We use polyaspartic topcoats that are UV-stable and won't yellow or fade despite Cincinnati's variable weather conditions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you work on Cincinnati's historic properties?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely! We have extensive experience with Cincinnati's historic homes and buildings, from Victorian mansions in Hyde Park to industrial buildings in Over-the-Rhine. We understand preservation requirements and work within historic district guidelines to enhance properties while maintaining their authentic character.</p>

                        <h3>What's the typical project timeline for Cincinnati installations?</h3>
                        <p>Most residential garage floors in Cincinnati can be completed in 1-2 days, depending on size and coating system chosen. Commercial projects vary based on square footage and complexity. We work efficiently to minimize disruption, whether you're in a busy Downtown office building or a quiet residential neighborhood.</p>

                        <p>Cincinnati's proximity to the Ohio River and underground water sources often creates basement moisture challenges. We start with comprehensive moisture testing, install vapor barriers when needed, and use moisture-mitigating primer systems. Our basement coatings are designed specifically for Cincinnati's groundwater and humidity conditions.</p>
