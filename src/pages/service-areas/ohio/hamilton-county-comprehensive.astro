Our experience with everything from 100-year-old buildings in Over-the-Rhine to modern corporate facilities gives us unique insights into what works best in each environment.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you handle projects in Cincinnati\'s historic districts?',
			answer: 'Historic districts like Over-the-Rhine require special consideration for preservation guidelines and older building characteristics. We work with architects, contractors, and city officials to ensure our coating solutions complement historic preservation goals while providing modern durability. Our experience includes projects in buildings dating from the 1800s, where we\'ve successfully addressed substrate challenges while maintaining historical integrity.'

		{
			question: 'What\'s your experience with Hamilton County\'s major institutions?',
			answer: 'We\'ve completed projects at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital, University of Cincinnati, Procter & Gamble facilities, and numerous other major institutions. Each sector has unique requirements - healthcare needs antimicrobial properties, educational facilities need durability and safety, corporate spaces need aesthetic appeal. Our institutional experience means we understand procurement processes, scheduling around operations, and meeting strict specifications.'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do you manage projects across Hamilton County\'s 49 municipalities?',
			answer: 'Each municipality has its own permitting requirements and regulations. We maintain relationships with building departments throughout the county and stay current on local codes. Our project management system tracks requirements for each jurisdiction, ensuring compliance whether we\'re working in Cincinnati\'s urban core or smaller communities like Golf Manor or Deer Park.'
		},
		{
			question: 'What seasonal considerations affect Hamilton County projects?',
			answer: 'Hamilton County\'s Ohio River valley climate brings humid summers and cold winters that affect coating applications. We schedule projects to optimize curing conditions, often recommending spring and fall installations. Winter projects are possible with proper environmental controls. We also consider the county\'s elevation changes and microclimates when planning installations, particularly for outdoor applications.'
